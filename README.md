Assumptions:
    - The air temperature is 15*C or 59*F
        Thus, kinematic viscosity is 1.48*10**-5 m/s/s
        
    - Also, air pressure is 1 atm (sea-levlel) and 0% humidity
        Thus, air density is 1.225 kg/(m^3)

    - Drag and lift coefficients are from "Aerodynamics of Golf Balls in Still Air"
        Assumptions and error in coefficient equations can be found in the publication
